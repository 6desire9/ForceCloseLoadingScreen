# ForceCloseLoadingScreen
1. World joining, loading, and reconfiguring screen
This mod fully disables the world loading screen and reconfiguration screen. This may cause a brief/temporary client to server position desync in Vanilla, but will provide a normal-ish experience where you just don't see the loading screen briefly flash on Paper/modded servers.

2. Resource pack loading screen
This mod also drastically reduces the resource pack loading screen duration by simply removing the forced fade-in and fade-out, which will be especially obvious on otherwise fast loading packs.
